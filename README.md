# About me

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a plugin project<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub

I'm proficient in JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, Lua, C#, C++, Java, Python â€” you name it!<br>
They all follow similar logic, so what truly matters is the creation itself, not the tools. ðŸ¤“
